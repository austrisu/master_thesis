  abstract     = {Industrial Control System({ICS}) testbed is the basis of {ICS} safety research. In order to build an {ICS} testbed, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of the current research status. This paper introduced the structure and composition of the typical {ICS} system. Then it simply analyzed the technical characteristics, system framework and advantages and disadvantages of four types of typical {ICS} testbeds. Finally, it summarized application scenarios of {ICS} testbed and pointed out some problems in testbed construction and the development direction of {ICS} testbed with the fusion of cyber and physical.},

  abstract  = {Conducting security tests such as vulnerability discovery within Industrial Control Systems ({ICS}) help reduce their vulnerability to cyber attacks. Unfortunately, the extreme availability requirements on {ICS} in operation make it difficult to conduct security tests in practice. For this reason, researchers and practitioners turn to testbeds that mimic real {ICS}. This study surveys {ICS} testbeds that have been proposed for scientific research. A total of 30 testbeds are identified. Most of these aim to facilitate vulnerability analysis, education and tests of defense mechanisms. Testbed components are typically implemented as simulation models. Testbed fidelity is rarely addressed, and at best briefly discussed.},

  abstract     = {Industrial control system security has been a topic of scrutiny and research for several years, and many security issues are well known. However, research efforts are impeded by a lack of an open virtual industrial control system testbed for security research. This paper describes a virtual testbed framework using Python to create discrete testbed compo- nents including virtual devices and process simulators. The virtual testbed is designed such that the testbeds are inter- operable with real industrial control system devices and such that the virtual testbeds can provide comparable industrial control system network behavior to a laboratory testbed. Two virtual testbeds modeled upon actual laboratory testbeds have been developed and have been shown to be inter-operable with real industrial control system equipment and vulnerable to attacks in the same manner as a real system. Additionally, these testbeds have been quantitatively shown to produce traffic close to laboratory systems.},

  abstract  = {Industrial Control Systems ({ICS}), at the heart of critical infrastructures, have been developing into more and more powerful tools over the years with the incorporation of networking and cyber, among other, technologies. As with great power comes great risks, {ICS}'s inherited risks and vulnerabilities not only from the cyber domain but also gave rise to unique security risks and vulnerabilities. Security management, i.e., identifying vulnerabilities, assessing threats, preventing and tolerating malicious and harmful activities, mitigating and recovering from attacks, etc., for {ICS}'s have been identified as a key, if not the key, area for the protection of critical infrastructures. The importance of a test-bed mimicking a real-life {ICS} and having capabilities to support {ICS} security management is paramount. In this paper, after briefly surveying the vulnerabilities in {ICS} and surveying the existing {ICS} test-beds, we describe the implementation of a virtual {ICS} testbed controlling the distribution breaker system of a power grid. We also describe simulating two cyber attacks using the testbed.},

The {ICS} testbed is a ideal platform since that it could make the security research more controllable and safe. In contrast to the physically replication testbed, the virtual testbed is more economic, safe and maintainable which will makes it advantageous in the laboratorial environment. In this paper, we present {VTET}, a virtual {ICS} testbed for cyber security research. {VTET} contains a virtual chemical industrial process, and both virtual and physical controllers. We provide a detailed description of {VTET} implementation such as the migration of controllers and the configuration of network. And we also demonstrate the 5 attack schemes simulated in {VTET} to prove its availability. Since the convenience of configuration and deployment, {VTET} is very suitable for academic {ICS} security research.},

  abstract     = {{SCADA} systems were made robust to sustain tough industrial environments, but little care was taken to raise defenses against potential cyber threats. With time, the threats started pouring in and eliciting major concerns in the research community. The extremely high cost and critical nature of {SCADA} Systems has made it nearly impossible for researchers to perform experiments with live cyber-attacks. Hence, replicating the behavior of these complicated systems by developing high-fidelity testbeds and testing the vulnerabilities on them provides researchers with the necessary workspace to combat the threats currently haunting these legacy systems. However, high-fidelity testbeds like Deter and {NSTB} are not portable and are hard to replicate. Even though it was possible to identify some portable testbeds, they all have poor support on the virtualization of the {SCADA} controller or use hardware-in-the-loop, which affects portability. In this research, a novel-modular framework is proposed to replicate complex {SCADA} Systems entirely on a virtual simulation, which makes them very low cost and portable. The process of virtualizing each major component is discussed. Finally, the success of this methodology is demonstrated by replicating real world critical infrastructures, which are presented as case studies as well as cyberattacks to demonstrate the use of the framework for cybersecurity research.},

Training can have two forms, the first is directed towards security professionals and aims at improving understanding of the latest threats and increasing skill levels in defending and mitigating against them. The second form of training, which used to attract less attention, aims at increasing cyber security awareness among non-security professionals and the general public. Conducting such training programs requires dedicated testbeds and infrastructures that help realizing and executing the training scenarios and provide a playground for the trainees. A cyber range is an environment that aims at providing such testbeds. The purpose of this paper is to study the concept of a cyber range, and provide a systematic literature review that covers unclassified cyber ranges and security testbeds. In this study we develop a taxonomy for cyber range systems and evaluate the current literature focusing on architecture and scenarios, but including also capabilities, roles, tools and evaluation criteria. The results of this study can be used as a baseline for future initiatives towards the development and evaluation of cyber ranges in accordance with existing best practices and lessons learned from contemporary research and developments.},

While the implementation of such testbeds presents significant investments and efforts, the implementation process itself is often not discussed in literature. In this chapter, we discuss the design and realization of such industrial control system testbeds for security research. In particular, we discuss a process in which testbeds are designed by security researchers to resemble existing (and future) plants, and are then implemented by commercial system integrators using industry's best practises.

We need a testbed system to check whether the whitelist function does not affect other functions of the controller. The industrial controller and its engineering tool are relatively expensive, and are customized with respect to controller vendors. To enhance the whitelist development, this study proposes a testbed system using {OpenPLC} which is an open-source software.

  abstract  = {Traditional control environments connected to physical systems are being upgraded with novel information and communication technologies. The resulting systems need to be adequately protected. Experimental testbeds are crucial for the study and analysis of ongoing threats against those resulting cyber-physical systems. The research presented in this paper discusses some actions towards the development of a replicable and affordable cyber-physical testbed for training and research. The architecture of the testbed is based on real-world components, and emulates cyber-physical scenarios commanded by {SCADA} (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) technologies. We focus on two representative protocols, Modbus and {DNP}3. The paper reports as well the development of some adversarial scenarios, in order to evaluate the testbed under cyber-physical threat situations. Some detection strategies are evaluated using our proposed testbed.},

  abstract     = {A testbed for evaluating if and how process-aware monitoring may increase the security of decentralized {SCADA} networks in power grids is presented. The testbed builds on the co-simulation framework Mosaik, and co-simulates in an integrated way, the power distribution network on different voltage levels, as well as the control network (Modbus/{TCP}). The existing simulators were extended to allow topology changes, and a controller ({RTU}) simulator connected to a {SCADA} server enabling remote control was implemented. Using the developed testbed, a recently proposed local monitoring approach was investigated. The results show that for so-called interlocks the proposed monitoring approach prevents the execution of 33.3\% of the commands, that would result in an unsafe state of the power distribution grid. Furthermore, it is shown that unsafe transformer tap positions can also be avoided. To illustrate the relevance and importance of the proposed testbed, a detailed comparison of related work on process-aware intrusion detection approaches and testbeds combining (parts of) the control network and the power grid is provided.},

  abstract     = {Electric power supply is an essential component for several sectors including manufacturing, healthcare, building management, water distribution, and transportation systems. Hence, any interruption in electric power is likely to have an undesirable impact on the overall operation of any residential or commercial ecosystem. The serious impacts of power supply interruption attacks have been realized in the recent cyber incidents such as the Ukraine power blackout. It is also evident from recent incidents that both network and process vulnerabilities are crucial for an adversary to cause an adverse impact on the operation. This paper reports an investigation into power supply interruption and malicious power generation attacks focusing on process and network vulnerabilities. The investigation was conducted in two steps: First, a vulnerability assessment was conducted on a fully operational electric power testbed. Next, the vulnerabilities discovered were exploited to perform different types of power supply interruption attacks and malicious power generation attacks. The attacks were executed using control code modification and {SMA}, a {PV} converter manufacturer, portal manipulation. The attacks reported here are useful for researchers and smart-grid operators to design and develop effective protection, detection, and response mechanisms.},

A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges ({CRs}) and Test-Beds ({TBs}), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented {CRs} and {TBs} platforms is evaluated. {CRs} and {TBs} are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented {CRs} and {TBs} research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of {CRs} and {TBs}. The taxonomy elaborates on the {CRs}/{TBs} dimensions, as well as, highlighting a diminishing differentiation between application areas.},

In particular, possible and plausible implementations of the aforementioned hysteresis controller in ladder logic are studied and described to the reader. Also, in the experimental results, this work explores how these implementations can be compromised by an injection attack to change settings and by a malicious ladder logic upload in the virtual testbed.

This paper presents a national experimental testbed for security research within supervisory control and data acquisition systems ({SCADA}), accessible for both research training and experiments. The virtualized testbed has been designed and implemented with both vendor experts and security researchers to balance the goals of realism with specific research needs. It includes a real {SCADA} product for energy management, a number of network zones, substation nodes, and a simulated power system. This environment enables creation of scenarios similar to real world utility scenarios, attack generation, development of defence mechanisms, and perhaps just as important: generating open datasets for comparative research evaluation.},

Industry automation came as the solution to increase quality, production and decrease costs. Since the early 70s, PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) has dominated industrial automation by replacing the relay logic circuits. However, due to its high costs, there are many places in the world where automation is still inaccessible. This paper describes the creation of a low-cost open source PLC, comparable to those already used in industry automation, with a modular and simplified architecture and expansion capabilities. Our goal with this project is to create the first fully functional standardized open source PLC. We believe that, with enough help from the open source community, it will become a low cost solution to speed up development and industrial production in less developed countries.},

  abstract = {Critical societal functions such as electricity and water purification depend on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to properly function. Not long ago, these ICS were realized by specially constructed isolated devices. Along with the rest of our society, ICS have evolved and are now often delivered by complex interconnected IT solutions including commercial-off-the-shelf technologies that in one way or another are connected to the Internet. As a consequence, ICS are vulnerable to IT attacks similarly to most other IT systems. Due to the extreme availability requirements on ICS in operation, it is difficult to perform cyber security experiments on them, such as vulnerability discovery or tests of defense mechanisms. To accommodate such experiments, researchers and practitioners turn to testbeds that mimic real ICS. This study first surveys ICS testbeds that have been proposed for scientific research. Special focus is given to field devices, a kind of ICS component that is considered particularly challenging to implement in testbeds. It then compares these results with findings from product surveys, practical experiences, and interviews with a manufacturer. The outcomes of this comparison are methods and tools for creating a high-fidelity ICS testbed. The study was conducted in collaboration with other actors, in particular, the Idaho National Laboratory.},

This laboratory combines model control systems from multiple critical infrastructure industries to create a testbed with functional physical processes controlled by commercial hardware and software over common industrial control system routable and non-routable networks. Laboratory exercises, functional demonstrations, and lecture material from the testbed have been integrated into a newly developed industrial control system cybersecurity course, into multiple other engineering and computer science courses, and into a series of short courses targeted to industry. Integration into the classroom allows the testbed to provide a workforce development function, prepares graduate students for research activities, and raises the profile of this research area with students. The testbed enables a research process in which cybersecurity vulnerabilities are discovered, exploits are used to understand the implications of the vulnerability on controlled physical processes, identified problems are classified by criticality and similarities in type and effect, and finally cybersecurity mitigations are developed and validated against within the testbed. Overviews of research enabled by the testbed are provided, including descriptions of software and network vulnerability research, a description of forensic data logger capability developed using the testbed to retrofit existing serial port MODBUS and DNP3 devices, and a description of intrusion detection research which leverages unique characteristics of industrial control systems.},

The VCSE allows a heterogeneous environment of real, emulated, and simulated components which allow the modeler freedom to instantiate components at varying levels of detail necessary for the analysis. Stronger modeling effort can be applied to specific systems under test while the remainder of the environment can be filled in with less labor-intensive elements. The VCSE includes software that federates and automates together capabilities across simulation domains (here, the control system components, their networking, and the power grid). This document introduces the VCSE approach to hybrid simulation of the grid and control systems (compared with other approaches). In particular, the VCSE incorporates one key feature: simulation software and hardware are federated through networking interfaces (both real and virtual). This allows for straightforward system-in-the-loop (SITL) analysis, which is of paramount importance for cyber security analysis, as the failure modes of the system under test depend so strongly on its ensemble characteristics (hardware/software/configuration/application). The paper also details the existing modeling approaches in VCSE for each major domain of simulation elements at the real/emulated/simulated levels.},

The NSTB Program is funded and directed by the DOE Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (DOE-OE). A key part of the program is the assessment of control systems to identify and provide mitigation approaches for vulnerabilities that could put the systems at risk to a cyber attack. Assessments are performed in the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) SCADA Test Bed and in operational installations at utilities, generation plants, and energy management facilities. Control system vendor software is tested in the SCADA Test Bed at INL. Operational control system assessments use nonintrusive methods, such as reviewing the production system network diagrams and firewall rules, and performing a hands-on assessment of a duplicate non-production installation of the system. SCADA systems are of the greatest interest in the assessments because they are the most common type of control system in the energy sector, controlling equipment ranging from valves in oil and gas pipelines to switches and breakers in the national electric grid. If compromised, an attacker could utilize these systems to cause catastrophic damage or outages directly or by exploiting paths to critical end devices or connected SCADA systems.},

We provide a brief overview of the implementation of the experimental setup on the testbed. We then present a case study using the IEEE 9 bus system to evaluate the impacts of cyber attacks on AGC. Specifically, we analyzed the impacts of measurement based attacks that manipulated the tie-line and frequency measurements, and control based attacks that manipulated the ACE values sent to generators. We found that these attacks could potentially create under frequency conditions and could cause unnecessary load shedding.

Cyber range offers this opportunity, but current research is lacking cost-effective solutions verticalized for the industrial domain. This work proposes ICSrange, a simulation-based cyber range platform for Industrial Control Systems. ICSrange adopts Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) technologies to virtualize an enterprise network connected to Industrial Control Systems. ICSrange is the outcome of a preliminary study intended to investigate challenges and opportunities to build a configurable and extensible cyber range with simulated industrial processes. Literature shows that testbeds based on realistic mock-ups are effectively employed to develop complex exploits like Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), hence motivating their usage to train and test security in ICS. We prove the effectiveness of ICSrange through the execution of a multi-staged attack that breaches an enterprise network and progressively intrudes a simulated ICS with water tanks. The attack mimics lateral movements as observed in APTs.},

Our gamification idea resulted in the design and implementation of the SWaT Security Showdown (S3). S3 is a Capture-The-Flag event specifically targeted at Industrial Control Systems security. We developed ICS-specific challenges involving both theoretical and applied ICS security concepts. The participants had access to a real water treatment facility and they interacted with simulated components and ICS honeypots.S3 includes international teams of attackers and defenders both from academia and industry. It was conducted in two phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style capture the flag event) served as a training session and presented novel categories not found in traditional information security CTFs. The live phase (an attack-defense CTF) involved teams testing new attack and defense techniques on SWaT: our water treatment testbed. During the competition we acted as judges, and we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we developed internally. Our scoring system is based on multiple factors, including realistic ICS attacker models and effectiveness of the detection mechanisms of the defenders. For each phase of the S3 we present the results and relevant statistics derived from the data that we collected during the event.},

  abstract = {Threats that have been primarily targeting nation states and their associated entities have expanded the target zone to include the private and corporate sectors. This class of threats, well known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), are those that every nation and well-established organization fears and wants to protect itself against. While nation-sponsored APT attacks will always be marked by their sophistication, APT attacks that have become prominent in corporate sectors do not make it any less challenging for the organizations. The rate at which the attack tools and techniques are evolving is making any existing security measures inadequate. As defenders strive to secure every endpoint and every link within their networks, attackers are finding new ways to penetrate into their target systems. With each day bringing new forms of malware, having new signatures and behavior that is close to normal, a single threat detection system would not suffice. While it requires time and patience to perform APT, solutions that adapt to the changing behavior of APT attacker(s) are required. Several works have been published on detecting an APT attack at one or two of its stages, but very limited research exists in detecting APT as a whole from reconnaissance to cleanup, as such a solution demands complex correlation and fine-grained behavior analysis of users and systems within and across networks. Through this survey paper, we intend to bring all those methods and techniques that could be used to detect different stages of APT attacks, learning methods that need to be applied and where to make your threat detection framework smart and undecipherable for those adapting APT attackers. We also present different case studies of APT attacks, different monitoring methods, and mitigation methods to be employed for fine-grained control of security of a networked system. We conclude this paper with different challenges in defending against APT and opportunities for further research, ending with a note on what we learned during our writing of this paper.},

  abstract = {New military technologies are destabilising. Computers used for attack are one such technology. NATO has made considerable progress in its efforts to integrate cybersecurity into its planning processes, but while it may have gone as far as the political environment allows, it needs to do more. NATO’s September 2014 summit established that cyber defence is part of the Alliance’s core tasks of collective defence, crisis management, and cooperative security. Consistent with its long history as a defensive organisation, the policy emphasised “prevention, detection, resilience, recovery.”2 Cyber defence has become a central component of NATO planning, given the success of Russia and others in compromising NATO networks. US intelligence sources assess that any unclassified NATO network that is directly connected to the internet should be considered potentially compromised and that cyber espionage is the principle threat to NATO systems over the next three years. They also assess that Russia, given its record of effective cyber collection, poses the greatest espionage threat to NATO computer networks.3 The vulnerable state of many NATO members’ national networks makes defence a priority, but it cannot be the only priority. Discussion within NATO has focused on a defensive role and on the issue of when a cyber incident could trigger the collective defence provision of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. NATO’s Computer Incident Response Capability (NCIRC), co-located with Allied Command Operations (ACO), is responsible for defending NATO networks. NATO is improving its cyber defence and helping member states improve their own cyber defences through information sharing, training, and if necessary, the deployment of rapid reaction cyber defence teams. These topics are essential for planning purposes, but leave NATO in a reactive mode when it comes to cyber},

Modbus and DNP3 are the most used protocols in the ICS world due to their compliance with real time needs. With the increasing of the connectivity to the internet world for business reasons, ICS adopted Internet based technologies and most of communication protocols are redesigned to work over IP. This openness exposed the ICS components as well as communication protocols to cyber-attacks with a higher risk than attacks on traditional IT systems. In order to facilitate the risk assessment of cyber-attacks on ICS protocols we propose a taxonomy model of different identified attacks on Modbus and DNP3.the model is based on the threat origin, threat type, attack type, attack scenario, vulnerability type and the impact of the attack.

  abstract     = {On February 5, 2021, unidentified cyber actors obtained unauthorized access to the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system at a U.S. drinking water treatment facility. The unidentified actors used the SCADA system’s software to increase the amount of sodium hydroxide, also known as lye, a caustic chemical, as part of the water treatment process. Water treatment plant personnel immediately noticed the change in dosing amounts and corrected the issue before the SCADA system’s software detected the manipulation and alarmed due to the unauthorized change. As a result, the water treatment process remained unaffected and continued to operate as normal. The cyber actors likely accessed the system by exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses, including poor password security, and an outdated operating system. Early information indicates it is possible that a desktop sharing software, such as TeamViewer, may have been used to gain unauthorized access to the system, although this cannot be confirmed at present date. Onsite response to the incident included Pinellas County Sheriff Office (PCSO), U.S. Secret Service (USSS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

The FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) have observed cyber criminals targeting and exploiting desktop sharing software and computer networks running operating systems with end of life status to gain unauthorized access to systems. Desktop sharing software, which has multiple legitimate uses—such as enabling telework, remote technical support, and file transfers—can also be exploited through malicious actors’ use of social engineering tactics and other illicit measures. Windows 7 will become more susceptible to exploitation due to lack of security updates and the discovery of new vulnerabilities. Microsoft and other industry professionals strongly recommend upgrading computer systems to an actively supported operating system. Continuing to use any operating system within an enterprise beyond the end of life status may provide cyber criminals access into computer systems.},

The identified deficiencies in DoD’s overall red team capability resulting from their adhoc implementation creates unknown mission risk to the Combatant Commands and Services leading to a significant threat to national security. Unfortunately, many senior DoD officials are citing a lack of resources as the reason for the deficiencies and believe an increase in funding will solve the issues. However, funding alone is not scalable to address DoD’s gaps in red team capability, and throwing more money to the existing adhoc process is quickly becoming a huge money pit for the DoD. This paper analyzes the deficiencies and concludes the primary cause to be a lack of a structured process needed to define, design, build, and sustain the required DoD red team capability. The solution presented is to treat the overall DoD cyber red team function as a complex system operating within a system of systems and apply the systems engineering process. Implementing a systems engineering process will eliminate some of the identified deficiencies through design and will identify feasible solutions or alternatives to the deficient areas which design cannot eliminate. The systems engineering process can help DoD build an effective and efficient red team capability which is needed to ensure the military can successfully execute its missions in the contestant cyber environment.},

  year     = {2009},
  abstract = {Recent events in Estonia and Georgia have elevated the threat of cyber attacks to the international consciousness. While this has added visibility to the topic, it has not brought more clarity to the discussion. Terms like cyber warfare and cyber terrorism are widely used, but their definitions are rarely agreed upon. As a result, there is lot of skepticism about the true nature of cyber threats and whether governments are engaging in such attacks in cyberspace. It should be safe to assume that all governments are developing and using defensive cyber capabilities to some degree. Defending computer systems is considered a right and typically legal frameworks support such activity. As soon as one goes on the cyber offensive, however, they are off the map. There is little consensus, let alone legal guidance, regarding the use of cyber attacks to further a political or military goal. Very few nations have announced an offensive capability in cyber space, but it is reasonable to assume that more are covertly creating such a capability. In this paper the term offensive cyber capability is used instead of the better known computer network attack (CNA). Offensive cyber capability differs from CNA by including actors from outside the direct control of the government, such as freelance hackers, criminals and flash mobs as possible extensions to a nation-state’s offensive capability. This paper offers a theoretical model composed of three approaches that a nation-state might use when creating an offensive cyber capability. First, the traditional use of ‘own forces’ is analyzed. The second way is to cultivate a volunteer force that can be guided to attack designated targets with little or no attribution to the government. The last approach is to outsource the problem to digital mercenaries. Each option has unique benefits and drawbacks, while some aspects remain universal across the board. In reality, the most effective approach is most likely a combination of all three.},

  abstract = {Owing to a growing number of attacks, the assessment of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) has gained in importance. An integral part of an assessment is the creation of a detailed inventory of all connected devices, enabling vulnerability evaluations. For this purpose, scans of networks are crucial. Active scanning, which generates irregular traffic, is a method to get an overview of connected and active devices. Since such additional traffic may lead to an unexpected behavior of devices, active scanning methods should be avoided in critical infrastructure networks. In such cases, passive network monitoring offers an alternative, which is often used in conjunction with complex deep-packet inspection techniques. There are very few publications on lightweight passive scanning methodologies for industrial networks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight passive network monitoring technique using an efficient Media Access Control (MAC) address-based identification of industrial devices. Based on an incomplete set of known MAC address to device associations, the presented method can guess correct device and vendor information. Proving the feasibility of the method, an implementation is also introduced and evaluated regarding its efficiency. The feasibility of predicting a specific device/vendor combination is demonstrated by having similar devices in the database. In our ICSi testbed, we reached a host discovery rate of 100% at an identification rate of more than 66%, outperforming the results of existing tools.},

  year     = {2011},
  abstract = {This white paper is a roadmap for new and emerging threats against industrial control systems (ICS) and the protocols on which field devices rely to communicate with control systems across a network. Protocols such as International Standards Organization Transport Service Access Point (ISO-TSAP RFC 1006) and others were designed, in the past, without any security in mind. These protocols were intended to be open and reliable, not secure. In fact, most Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) were also built on the assumption that security was unnecessary as long as the device was deployed inside an “air gap” network. However, recent events, such as the widespread dissemination of Stuxnet, have demonstrated that this is not a safe assumption on which to base critical design implementation decisions. We must consider where these devices are deployed; PLCs are used in power plants (including nuclear), pipelines, oil and gas refineries, hydroelectric dams, water and waste, and weapon systems. We cannot simply rest idle and wait for something to fail or, worse, explode. We must act now, and we must be diligent in mitigating these issues. ICS vendors together with the help of ICS-CERT should work with independent security researchers to promote responsible disclosure. In this paper we will discuss, reconnaissance, fingerprinting, replay attacks, authentication bypass methods, and remote exploitation, and how these techniques can be used to attack a Siemens Simatic S7 PLC.},

The worm scans the network for new targets (PLCs), attacks these targets and replicates itself onto the found targets. The original main program running on the target is not modified. Once infected the worm on the target again starts the scan. We will analyze the impact of the worm on the target and possible mitigation techniques.},

Several consortia, such as the German initiative Industrie 4.0, recommend to use the OPCUA framework to manage interoperability issues. Associate to the convergence of the Operational Technology (OT) and the Information Technology (IT) domains, it may lead to create a new attack surface, that needs to be apprehended. The contribution is therefore to identify, based on the specifications, the threats and countermeasures that may occur/be applied when using OPC-UA in an Industry 4.0 environment and to highlight the impact of the eavesdropping and message flooding attacks on an OPC-UA application implemented on a real testbed.},

  abstract  = {Real-Time Ethernet has become the major communication technology for modern automation and industrial control systems. On the one hand, this trend increases the need for an automation-friendly security solution, as such networks can no longer be considered sufficiently isolated. On the other hand, it shows that, despite diverging requirements, the domain of Operational Technology (OT) can derive advantage from high-volume technology of the Information Technology (IT) domain. Based on these two sides of the same coin, we study the challenges and prospects of approaches to communication security in real-time Ethernet automation systems. In order to capitalize the expertise aggregated in decades of research and development, we put a special focus on the reuse of well-established security technology from the IT domain. We argue that enhancing such technology to become automation-friendly is likely to result in more robust and secure designs than greenfield designs. Because of its widespread deployment and the (to this date) nonexistence of a consistent security architecture, we use PROFINET as a showcase of our considerations. Security requirements for this technology are defined and different well-known solutions are examined according their suitability for PROFINET. Based on these findings, we elaborate the necessary adaptions for the deployment on PROFINET.},

These configurable IED models allow the engineers to easily build SAS network model with different topologies for all kinds of substations so that the dynamic performance issues could be studied and rules could be developed to guide the SAS network planning and design.

  abstract  = {The rapid evolution of the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) services transforms the conventional electrical grid into a new paradigm called Smart Grid (SG). Even though SG brings significant improvements, such as increased reliability and better energy management, it also introduces multiple security challenges. One of the main reasons for this is that SG combines a wide range of heterogeneous technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices as well as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The latter are responsible for monitoring and controlling the automatic procedures of energy transmission and distribution. Nevertheless, the presence of these systems introduces multiple vulnerabilities because their protocols do not implement essential security mechanisms such as authentication and access control. In this paper, we focus our attention on the security issues of the IEC 60870-5-104 (IEC-104) protocol, which is widely utilized in the European energy sector. In particular, we provide a SCADA threat model based on a Coloured Petri Net (CPN) and emulate four different types of cyber attacks against IEC-104. Last, we used AlienVault's risk assessment model to evaluate the risk level that each of these cyber attacks introduces to our system to confirm our intuition about their severity.},
